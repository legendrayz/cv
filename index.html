  <h3>WHY WE SHOULD PLAY GAMES</h3>


<table  cellspacing="6">

  <tr>
    <td>Games are fun and source of positive emotions </td>
    <td>Games help us tap into positive emotions, like curiosity, optimism, creativity. You enjoy it just for the sake of enjoying. These emotions stay up hours after we play! Unless someone beats your high-score, of course</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Winning games makes you (feel) heroic</td>
    <td>laying games bring people together, it is the competition among peers that adds adrenaline. After a success in a game, we are more likely to set an ambitious goal for ourselves, even outside of gaming. Basically, games can turn your
      superpowers on. Try yourself!</td>
